  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

  #  cpu: 100m

# base64 encoded data of the required file config.toml
# Instructions: 
# 1) Cretae a config.toml file as described at: https://github.com/gustavkarlsson/rocketchat-jira-trigger#configuration-file
# 2) Base64 encode it doing the following command:
# openssl enc -base64 < config.toml
# 3) Paste the results here. 
# The bellow value creates a default one that will not work for your server. You have to overide it in your own values.yaml file
